<h3>Brief Intro</h3>
<div>

By using <strong>Astro Isha</strong> the astrologers can focus on Client Queries and Astrological Reading. But coming into 2017 there are changes made to the 
website so now Yoga Experts, Vastu Shastra or Feng Shui Experts, those involved in Karma Kand, Pujas and Yagnas, Numerologists, Ayurveda Experts can all connect with clients 
and those interested in getting expertise from them. They need not make blogs, websites or worry about Payments anymore. 
Astro Isha would provide them with a chance to add Content, Articles and post their details online. They would also be able to receive client payments online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clients can ask Online Queries, Pay Online and also connect with Experts in fields mentioned above residing in any part of the world. They can find Astrologers leaving in their local areas via Astro Search(Coming Soon).</p>

<h3>History Of Astro Isha</h3>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astro Isha was founded on 2nd April 2014. It was formally registered as a Company on 30th September 2015 under Shop Establishment Act 1948 with Registration Number: PII/MJRG/2900050/0111946. 
Astro Isha was initially started in February 2013 under the name <strong>Jyotishi Vidya</strong>(www.jyotishividya.co.in) but was later changed to Astro Isha so as to avoid confusion with other websites bearing similar names.</p>
</div>
<h3>Purpose Of Astro Isha</h3>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astro Isha is a website for Astrologers and Experts in related field with Vedic Connection as well as 
    for Clients seeking expertise of those Astrologers and from related Vedic Fields. Astrologers and Astrology has its fair share of 
critiques and believers. Both are partially right in their judgement. Astrology like all subjects has its positives and negatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal of Astro Isha would be to separate parts of Vedic Knowledge which are based on Reasoning, Logic, Probability, Statistics, Computation and Research which are purely Mathematical 
Fields from the Social Evils like Superstition, Fear and Paranoia. Astrology and related Vedic Fields were founded on mathematical concepts like Probability and as well as Stats and Observation which were gathered over a long period of time. But slowly but surely social evils like 
fear and superstition took over reasoning and logic part. Astro Isha is intended to filter the evils and try to show the logical and rational side of Vedic Knowledge.</p>
