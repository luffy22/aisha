<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="<?php echo JURI::base() ?>logo.png" title="Welcome To Astro Isha" class="img-responsive" align="left" hspace="10" />Astro Isha was founded as means to connect astrologers with clients who seek astrological advise. 
By using <strong>Astro Isha</strong> the astrologers can focus on client queries and astrological reading. At present the astrologer registration has been taken down due to technical issues. But 
we hope to fix it soon and let astrologers register and share content with us. 
Astro Isha would provide them with a chance to add content, articles and post their details online. They would also be able to receive client payments online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clients can ask online queries, Pay online and also connect with astrological experts in other parts of the world.</p>
<div class="lead alert alert-dark">History Of Astro Isha</div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astro Isha was founded on 2nd April 2014. It was formally registered as a Company on 30th September 2015 under Shop Establishment Act 1948 with Registration Number: PII/MJRG/2900050/0111946. 
Astro Isha was initially started in February 2013 under the name <strong>Jyotishi Vidya</strong>(www.jyotishividya.co.in) but was later changed to Astro Isha so as to avoid confusion with other websites bearing similar names.</p>
<div class="lead alert alert-dark">Purpose Of Astro Isha</div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal of Astro Isha would be to separate parts of vedic knowledge which are based on reasoning, logic, probability, statistics, computation and research which are purely mathematical 
fields from social evils like superstition, fear and paranoia. Astrology and related vedic fields were founded on mathematical concepts like probability and as well as stats and observation which were gathered over a long period of time. But slowly but surely social evils like 
fear and superstition took over reasoning and logic part. Astro Isha is intended to filter the evils and try to show the logical and rational side of vedic knowledge.</p>
